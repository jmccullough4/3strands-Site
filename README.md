# 3 Strands Cattle Co. Website

Static marketing website for 3 Strands Cattle Co. highlighting mission, premium livestock offerings, and contact options.

## Local development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or run a static file server bound to the expected host and port:

```bash
python -m http.server 8081 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081).

## Branding assets

The production deployment should include `assets/img/logo.png`, which contains the 3 Strands Cattle Co. logo referenced throughout the site. The file is omitted from version control and must be supplied during deployment.

## Contact form delivery

The "Contact Us" form posts to [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co), which relays submissions to `info@3strand.co` without opening a local mail client. The first submission from a new deployment will trigger a confirmation email from FormSubmitâ€”approve it once to activate delivery. Consider adding FormSubmit's confirmation address to your allowlist to ensure reliable notifications.
