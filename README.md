# 3 Strands Cattle Co. Website

Static marketing website for 3 Strands Cattle Co. highlighting mission, premium livestock offerings, and contact options.

## Local development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or run a static file server bound to the expected host and port:

```bash
python -m http.server 8081 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081).

## Branding assets

The production deployment should include `assets/img/logo.png`, which contains the 3 Strands Cattle Co. logo referenced throughout the site. The file is omitted from version control and must be supplied during deployment.

## Contact form delivery

The "Contact Us" form posts to [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co), which relays submissions to `info@3strands.co` without opening a local mail client. The first submission from a new deployment will trigger a confirmation email from FormSubmitâ€”approve it once to activate delivery. The delivered message includes a "3 Strands Cattle Co. Website Inquiry" header along with the submitted fields so the team can quickly recognize website leads. Consider adding FormSubmit's confirmation address to your allowlist to ensure reliable notifications.

## Live chat configuration

The live chat section is prewired for [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/). To enable it:

1. Create a Crisp workspace and add a website.
2. Copy the generated **Website ID** (a short alphanumeric string).
3. Update the `data-chat-id` attribute on the `.live-chat-content` wrapper in `index.html` with that ID. The placeholder is currently empty so the button stays disabled until configured.

Once the ID is in place, the site will load the Crisp widget automatically and the "Launch Live Chat" button will open the chat drawer. Remove the `disabled` attribute only if you want the button active before Crisp loads.
